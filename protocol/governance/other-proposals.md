# Other Proposals

Any proposal that does not fit the pre-listed proposals can be submitted as a [**Text Poll**](proposal-types.md#1-submit-text-poll). A text poll consists of a simple title that should describe the intention of the proposal, a short description of the proposal, and an optional field to include an external link. 

Given that the text poll smart contract only supports very short descriptions \(currently 64-bits\), it is advisable to include a more detailed description on an external link and then attach the link in the `Information Link` field.
